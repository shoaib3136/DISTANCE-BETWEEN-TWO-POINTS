# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance between two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import math module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2:
Give the values of co-ordinates to find distance between two points that is distance between l1,l2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula

### Step 4: 
Then print the value of distance
### Step 5:
End the program 
### PROGRAM:
```

import math as m
l1=[10,6]
l2=[4,2]
d=m.sqrt((l1[0]-l2[0])**2+(l1[1]-l2[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```

### OUTPUT:
